AiiDA virtual hands-on tutorial workshop in 2021 Spring
=======================================================

Plan
----

This is a training session to feel AiiDA
(http://www.aiida.net/). People who want to join will get together by
themselves. No fee is required to join. At this time, the number of
participants will have to be kept minimum because we don't have enough
people to support participants.

In the hands-on tutorial, we will basically follow the `previous AiiDA
tutorial material
<https://aiida-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/2020_Intro_Week/index.html>`_,
where the section 1 is replaced by this page: :ref:`quantum_mobile_setup`. Participants are requested to
install virtualbox to setup Quantum mobile following :ref:`quantum_mobile_setup`
on their own PCs and the hands-on tutorials can be started before the workshop.

Date & Location
----------------

2 days AiiDA hands-on tutorial workshop will be held
on 10-11th of May by a virtual zoom meeting.

Schedule
--------

In principle, no rigorous schedule is set-up. Participants will work
on the tutorial materials or what they want to do in their own
paces. Questions and discussions will be raised accordingly.

Preparation of AiiDA environment on your computer
-------------------------------------------------

Most participants are recommended to prepare Quantum Mobile on their
PCs. Quantum Mobile contains not only AiiDA daemon but also the open
source software packages (e.g., Quantum Espresso) that are required to
run the tutorial materials.

Advanced participants may prepare AiiDA environment on
their system by themselves.

For VASP users, AiiDA-VASP can be installed following this
documentation. AiiDA-VASP (the AiiDA plugin for VASP) itself is an
open source code, but VASP is not. Only the participants who have the
valid license can run the VASP code on their computers.
